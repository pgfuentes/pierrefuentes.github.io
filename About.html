									Pierre G Fuentes</a></h2>
									<p>I am a Web Developer with newly aquired <br />
										front and back end skills who loves being with his wife and 3 children<br />
									while learning new coding methodologies and new tech</p>

												<p> <br> I am currently working as an operations manager and recently moved from Toronto to Ottawa. My current job role as interesing and demanding as it is, I feel there is an 
													
													important ingredient that is missing in my professional career.  This has allowed me to identify an opportunity to be on an exciting new path into web development. I have great interest in how web applications work and learning new ways to 
													
													innovate my skills and my projects. <br />
														
														<br> My first endeavor was Ruby on Rails. In an effort to expand on my skills further, I completed the Full-Stack Bootcamp certification through University of Toronto where I added skills like JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS.

														I am continuing my education informally by taking online courses to maintain these skill sets current and up-to-date. <br />
														
														<br />
														I believe my "can-do" attitude, work ethic, problem solving & communication skills will make me an asset to any development team.
